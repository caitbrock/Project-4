### Next Steps: 

Moving forward, a few items to further implement would be:

1. Pull the image url from AWS to display it on the home page.
2. Build out the pages required for building a board and add more functionality.
3. Continue to build out the filter features of the app.
4. Continue to refine the chat portion of the app to allow for greater interaction.
5. Create a profile page where the travellers information and previous travels are displayed.
