### Project Description:

Have you ever created random lists of potential restaurants, hotels, destinations, ect. you want to visit? What about taking random screenshots that get saved haphazardly in your phone prior to a trip? Travelspo is a social media platform that provides aspiring travellers with a location to save information related to travels.

- The app allows users to sign up at which point they will indicate some travel preferences, which will help to filter inspo images.
- The 'Inspo Feed' includes filtered images (based on indicated interests) which users are able to scroll through and add to specific themed boards they create within 'Boards'. 
- Users can also upload and apply tags to their own images so it can be added to the database and used to inspire others.
- Travelspo also includes a chat feature which allows aspiring travellers to connect with others on the platform.

### Next Steps: 

Moving forward, a few items to further implement would be:

1. Pull the image url from AWS to display it on the home page.
2. Build out the pages required for building a board and add more functionality.
3. Continue to build out the filter features of the app.
4. Continue to refine the chat portion of the app to allow for greater interaction.
5. Create a profile page where the travellers information and previous travels are displayed.
